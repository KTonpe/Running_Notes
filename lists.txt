. you can't add a number into empty list at any location
	sample_list =[]
	sample_list[index] =  number -> it will throw a error

. so you convert the number in list form and add two list
	sample_list + [3]     	     -> append at index 0

. you can fill the list with data :
	sample_list = [0]*3 -> [0,0,0]
